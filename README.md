- hi, i’m @Liora00
- i'm a new-ish dev who mostly knows python and luau (yes, that's a real language, not a typo!)
- i'm currently pretty inactive here, and i may not notice anything happening.

- you can find me as liora0 on discord, if you need to contact me (i probably can't help you with much though)
- i go by she/her pronouns. respect them, please.
